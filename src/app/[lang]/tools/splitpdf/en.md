This tool splits PDF files directly in your browser with no server upload. It supports the same split methods as the Word split tool: single page, odd/even pages, page ranges, fixed page count, page-break mode (equivalent to single-page mode in PDF), and Heading 1 mode (top-level PDF bookmarks).

## How to use

1. Upload one `.pdf` file (processed locally in your browser).
2. Choose a split mode and fill mode-specific options (for example `1-5;8-12` for ranges).
3. Configure output naming rules (prefix, suffix, start index, zero padding).
4. Click split and download outputs one-by-one or as a ZIP package.

## Features

- 6 split modes aligned with the Word split tool.
- Heading-based split uses top-level PDF bookmarks.
- PDF page-level splitting is usually more accurate than Word pagination.
- Output files preserve the original page layout and visual content.
