      "title": "World Population Change (1800-2015)",
      "intro": "The world population has shown a continuous growth trend since 1800, with population growth accelerating significantly towards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century and the economic development it brought improved living conditions in most countries globally, leading to accelerated population growth. From the mid-20th century, developing countries such as China and India experienced rapid population growth. In contrast, high-income countries saw a gradual slowdown in population growth rates after entering the 20th century."
    },
    "income-growth": {
      "title": "Global Income Change (1800-2015)",
      "intro": "In 1800, the income in the United Kingdom was already several times higher than many countries, with the Industrial Revolution greatly widening the gap between high-income countries and others. Compared to industrialized nations, countries like India, China, and some African nations saw little change in income levels for most of the 19th century. The rapid development of emerging economies such as China and India in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has gradually brought these countries' income levels closer to those of high-income countries. Although global income has grown overall in the latter part of the 20th century, income disparities between high-income and low-income countries still persist. The change in global income has experienced a hugely unbalanced development, initially dominated by the income growth of developed countries driven by the Industrial Revolution, and later transformed by the rise of emerging economies, but significant global income disparities remain."
    },
    "china_gdp": {
      "title": "China GDP Change (2004-2023)",
      "intro": "China's economy has experienced significant growth over the past 20 years. Taking Guangdong Province as an example, its GDP increased from 1,865.83 billion yuan in 2004 to 13,567.32 billion yuan in 2023, growing approximately 6.3 times. By comparing growth rates across different regions and periods, we can observe an overall trend of slowing economic growth. For instance, Guangdong Province's average annual growth rate was about 14.4% during 2004-2013, while it decreased to about 8.0% during 2014-2023. This indicates that China's economy is transitioning from a high-speed growth phase to a high-quality development phase. Beijing and Shanghai, as municipalities directly under the central government, have relatively high total GDP, which may reflect their status as centers for finance, technology, and service industries. Even in the face of global economic challenges (such as in 2020), most regions maintained positive growth, demonstrating the resilience of China's economy."
    },
    "china_population": {
      "title": "China Population Change (2004-2023)",
      "intro": "The analysis reveals a clear divergence in population trends across China's provinces. Eastern coastal regions such as Beijing, Guangdong, and Shanghai show significant population growth, with average increases ranging from 1.5% to 2%. These areas attract large numbers of migrants due to their economic prosperity and abundant job opportunities. In contrast, northeastern provinces like Heilongjiang and Jilin are experiencing negative population growth, with Heilongjiang seeing the most significant decrease (-1.15%). These regions are facing industrial decline and population outflow. Some central and western provinces, such as Guizhou and Gansu, are also seeing slower population growth. Future demographic changes will likely focus on the relationship between urbanization and regional economic disparities. Eastern economic centers may continue to attract populations, while provinces with less diversified economies may struggle with population loss."
    },
    "china_income": {
      "title": "China Income Change (2004-2023)",
      "intro": "The analysis reveals significant regional disparities in fiscal revenues across Chinese provinces, with coastal provinces like Guangdong and Jiangsu far outperforming inland provinces such as Tibet and Qinghai, reflecting uneven economic development. Nevertheless, most provinces showed a continuous growth trend from 2004 to 2023, demonstrating China's overall economic progress. However, recent years have seen a general slowdown in growth rates, possibly reflecting the impact of economic transformation and structural adjustments. Notably, some provinces like Guizhou and Tibet have experienced rapid fiscal revenue growth, likely tied to national regional development strategies and support policies. Meanwhile, provinces with diversified economic structures, such as Guangdong and Zhejiang, have shown stronger resilience to economic fluctuations, highlighting the importance of industrial diversity for fiscal stability."

      "title": "China Expenditure Change (2004-2023)",
      "intro": "The analysis reveals a continuous growth trend in fiscal expenditure across Chinese provinces, reflecting the government's increasing investment in people's livelihoods and economic development. However, there are significant regional differences in the scale and growth rate of expenditures, with economically developed eastern coastal provinces like Guangdong and Jiangsu far outspending western provinces like Qinghai and Ningxia, highlighting the vast disparity in fiscal strength. Notably, some central and western provinces such as Sichuan and Guizhou have seen faster expenditure growth, possibly linked to national strategies for balanced regional development. "
